# Battleship

A classic guessing game for two players.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mickaelpham/battleship
bundle install
gem build battleship.gemspec
gem install battleship-0.1.0.gem
```

This should take care of installing the `battleship` executable in your `PATH`,
allowing you to start a new game from the shell:

```
$ battleship
```
